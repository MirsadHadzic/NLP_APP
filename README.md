# NLP_APP

NLP_APP is a mobile application built using Xamarin and C#, designed initially for Android with future plans for iOS compatibility. The choice of Xamarin and C# enables cross-platform development, allowing for efficient deployment across multiple operating systems.
This app is used for giving the positive or negative feedback depending on what the User wrote, said etc.

## Features
- **Text Analysis:** Utilizes the power of Natural Language Processing (NLP) for sentiment analysis, text summarization, and other text-related tasks.
- **URL Analysis:** Provides functionality to analyze the content of URLs for various insights.
- **Audio Processing:** Incorporates OpenAI's advanced AI models for audio processing tasks, enhancing the app's capabilities.
- **User Authentication:** Implements user authentication using PHP scripts hosted on a server with PHPMyAdmin. The app communicates with these scripts to handle new user registration, user login, and log actions securely.

## Technologies Used
- **Xamarin:** A cross-platform framework for building mobile applications using C#.
